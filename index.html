<p>I create videos on topics that are trending within the current time and generation. I look at the themes and ideas within such media and highlight the importance of it in comparison to one's identity and psychology. By interpreting the works of certain individuals through either their films, games or shows, I showcase the importance of what it means to create. Oftentimes these videos that I create encapsulates certain themes that relate to the topic that the filmmakers or game developers want to bring into light. At the same time, I try to make it as entertaining as possible. Medias such as games and movies all hold deeper meanings, but at the core of it all, whether you enjoyed it or found it entertaining is what matters most. Through the use of mainly photoshop, premiere pro and after effects, I aim to create videos that highlight the artistic talents of many individuals in todayâ€™s world. There are things done in video games and films that often go unnoticed, and I try to point it out so as to give credit where it is due.
